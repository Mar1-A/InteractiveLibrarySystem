# InteractiveLibrarySystem
Automation of library management system has been studied over the years by many stakeholders.
The main purpose of such system is to mechanise library housekeeping operations predominantly
by computerisation. In this coursework you will create an interactive ‘prototype’ library
management application to focus on basic operations in a library like adding new books, new
members, searching books and members and facility to borrow and return books; and updating
information about books and members. The application should store all the information about
books and members in a persistent storage e.g. files.
